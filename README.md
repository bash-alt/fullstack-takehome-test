# ðŸ’¸ Budget Tracking App

Welcome! As a fintech studio, we're always working to build better digital finance tools for our customers. The purpose of the technical challenge is to give us insight in your technical abilities, design & development approach and general technical skills.

**Please treat this technical challenge as confidential.**

Good luck with the challenge!

## Assignment

The challenge consists of a coding exercise to prepare beforehand and will be concluded by an in-person/virtual discussion of your solution. Please keep a log of the significant design decisions you make during development. A brief sentence per decision is enough, but use your own judgement on the level of detail. These design decisions will be further discussed during the in-person/virtual interview.

In this takehome assignment, you'll be building an app to help a person track his or her budget. Start out by assuming there will only be one user for the app. The user should be able to see their balance and enter in transactions that reduce or increase the amount of money available. Some sample data is included in *data.json*. You have one week to work on this challenge.

Here's the list of features we'd like our app to support:

* User should be able to see their balance
* Fetching accounts data from the API and displaying it in a list
* Adding, viewing and filtering transactions by type (Credit vs Debit)
* Test coverage - please include a few tests, we don't expect full coverage.

You can use any technology stack to complete this challenge.

### Expectation

* We donâ€™t expect a fully production grade application, but will be looking for quality code and best practices.
* We want you to express your best design and coding skills.
* Consider aspects such as security, robustness, maintainability, automated testing, etc.
* We prefer self-documenting code.
* Commits can help to show us how you tackle the problem and organize your solution. Commit as often as you like, the more the better.

#### Authentication
If you want to add authentication to your services then you can use https://www.okta.com/ and register a free developer account.

## Front-End

Use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to develop a responsive web app with a list of accounts, transactions and a login/logout button.

### Requirements:

- Demonstrate use of web standards including HTML5
- Use a separate CSS file
- Make the navbar responsive with at least one breakpoint (your choice as to how it looks on a smaller screen width)
- Follow the style guidelines listed below
- Add buttons or links to login/logout
- A small front-end is ok.

### Bonuses

- Use SASS or LESS to pre-compile your CSS.   
- Add a CSS animation with transitions.   
- Use JavaScript to control whether the login or the logout button is shown; only one should be visible at a time.

	- add a transaction
	- add a transaction to the list for an account

### Bonuses:

- Use appropriate HTTP status codes.  
- Include a route to remove a transaction.


## Evaluation

We'll evaluate your submission on the following criteria:

* Functionality: Does your solution work as intended and meet the spec for the API? Is your code written defensively, i.e., does it handle invalid inputs and errors?
* Craft: Does your code follow best practices and expected behavior? Is your code easy to read and commented appropriately?

Your deliverables should include

* Your application should be hosted with a password to enter.
* You should provide a **README** containing instructions on how to clonee and start your application locally as well as the password for the live site.

Please create a **private GitHub repo** with your solution and share instructions to the reviewer/s on how to run your application/s. Please give the following github users access [Jabu](https://github.com/Jabu09),[Paul]() [Sihle](https://github.com/sihle-basalt) (Read access is sufficient).
